    "\n",
    "in [stage 0](#Stage-0---Basic-Python-commands) we'll go through Python basics. If you've never used Python or programming before, you'll want to start here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [stage 1](#Stage-1---Compute-LCOE), we'll write a Python function which computes the levelised cost of electricity from input data. We'll then test that this function produces the result we expect. You'll be able to check that your function works at the end of the stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [stage 2](#Stage-2---Explore-Parameter-Values), we'll then use the function you wrote to compute LCOE for one technology and explore what happens when you change the parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "in [stage 3](#Stage-3:-Comparing-technologies), we'll use the LCOE function again to compare technologies against one another, and develop screen curves that allow us to visualise the trade offs between technologies as a function of load-factor.\n",
