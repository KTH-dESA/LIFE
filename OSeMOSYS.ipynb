    "Each file relates to one parameter in OSeMOSYS. \n",
    "For example, you could edit the `CapitalCost` of technologies of the `year` model by editing \n",

    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of variables is decided by the solver, a piece of software used to \"solve\" the system of equations we use to define the energy system.\n",
    "Broadly, variables are defined the investment decisions, and operational decisions. \n",
    "By changing the value of the decision variables, the solver can minimise the objective function.\n",
